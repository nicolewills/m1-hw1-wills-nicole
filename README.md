# My First Coding Assignment #

## About Me ##
My name is Nicole! I'm 24 years old and I live in Orlando, Florida. Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, yoga, and bar trivia. When I'm not doing one of those things, I'm probably hanging out with my cat, Stevie (named after Stevie Nicks)!

## Past Coding Experience ##
I don't have a ton of coding experience. When I was a freshman in college, I was an Information Technology major for my first semester and took a class called Intro to Programming in C. We did some work in Python and C++ in that class as well. It's been a while though, so I can't say I remember anything that we covered besides the bare basics! Besides that, I have more recent experience making minor tweaks to HTML and CSS in WordPress and HubSpot.

## Career Goals ##
1. Graduate with my MA in Mass Communication and Graduate Certificate in Web Design
2. Gain more experience in creative strategy
3. Launch a freelancing side gig (hopefully in web design!)
